# Cleaning and Transformation of large data sets

Preceding the filtering/selection/aggregation of raw data,  data cleaning and transformation typically have to be run on large parts of the overall dataset. In practice, the bottleneck is often a lack of RAM. In the following, we explore two strategies that broadly build on the idea of *virtual memory* (using parts of the hard disk as RAM).


## 'Out-of-memory' strategies

Virtual memory is in simple words an approach to combining the RAM and mass storage components in order to cope with a lack of RAM. Modern operating systems come with a virtual memory manager that would automatically handle the swapping between RAM and the hard-disk, when running processes use up too much RAM. However, a virtual memory manager is not specifically developed to perform this task in the context of data analysis. Several strategies have thus been developed to build on the basic idea of virtual memory in the context of data analysis tasks.

- *Chunked data files on disk*: The data analytics software 'partitions' the large dataset, maps, and stores the chunks of raw data on disk. What is actually 'read' into RAM when importing the data file with this approach is the mapping to the partitions of the actual dataset (the data structure) and some metadata describing the dataset. In R, this approach is implemented in the `ff` package and several packages building on `ff`. In this approach, the usage of disk space and the linking between RAM and files on disk is very explicit (and well visible to the user).

- *Memory mapped files and shared memory*: The data analytics software uses segments of virtual memory for the dataset and allows different programs/processes to access it in the same memory segment. Thus, virtual memory is explicitly allocated for one or several specific data analytics tasks. In R, this approach is prominently implemented in the `bigmemory` package and several packages building on `bigmemory`.


### Chunking data with the `ff`-package

Before looking at the more detailed and applied code examples in @walkowiak_2016, we investigate how the `ff` package (and the concept of chunked files) basically works. In order to do so, we first install and load the `ff` and `ffbase` packages, as well as the `pryr` package. We use the already known `flights.csv`-dataset as an example. When importing data via the `ff` package, we first have to set up a directory where `ff` can store the partitioned dataset (recall that this is explicitly/visibly done on disk). As in the code examples of the book, we call this new directory `ffdf` (after `ff`-data.frame).

```{r message=FALSE}

# SET UP --------------

# install.packages(c("ff", "ffbase"))
# load packages
library(ff)
library(ffbase)
library(pryr)

# create directory for ff chunks, and assign directory to ff 
system("mkdir ffdf")
options(fftempdir = "ffdf")

```

Now we can read in the data with `read.table.ffdf`. In order to better understand the underlying concept, we record the change in memory in the R environment with `mem_change()`.

```{r}
mem_change(
flights <- 
     read.table.ffdf(file="../data/flights.csv",
                     sep=",",
                     VERBOSE=TRUE,
                     header=TRUE,
                     next.rows=100000,
                     colClasses=NA)
)
```

Note that there are two substantial differences to what we have previously seen when using `fread()`. It takes much longer to import a csv into the ffdf structure. However, the RAM allocated to it is much smaller. This is exactly what we would expect, keeping in mind what `read.table.ffdf()` does in comparison to what `fread()` does.

Now we can actually have a look at the data chunks created by `ff`, as well as how the structure of the dataset is represented in the `flights` object.

```{r}
# show the files in the directory keeping the chunks
list.files("ffdf")

# investigate the structure of the object created in the R environment
str(flights)

```



### Memory mapping with `bigmemory`

The `bigmemory`-package handles data in matrices, and therefore only accepts variables in the same data type. Before importing data via the `bigmemory`-package, we thus have to ensure that all variables in the raw data can be imported in a common type. This example follows the example of the package authors given [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/vignettes/Overview.pdf).^[We only use a fraction of the data used in the package vignette example, the full raw data used there can be downloaded [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html).]

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# SET UP ----------------

# load packages
library(bigmemory)
library(biganalytics)

# import the data
flights <- read.big.matrix("../data/flights.csv",
                     type="integer",
                     header=TRUE,
                     backingfile="flights.bin",
                     descriptorfile="flights.desc")
```

Note that, similar to the `ff`-example, `read.big.matrix()` initiates a local file-backing `flights.bin` on disk which is linked to the `flights`-object in RAM. From looking at the imported file, we see that various variable values have been discarded. This is due to the fact that we have forced all variables to be of type `"integer"` when importing the dataset. 

```{r}
summary(flights)
```





# Cleaning and Transformation 


## Typical tasks (independent of data set size)

- Normalize/standardize.
- Code additional variables (indicators, strings to categorical, etc.).
- Remove, add covariates.
- Merge data sets.
- Set data types.

## Typical workflow

1. Import raw data.
2. Clean/transform.
3. Store for analysis.
     - Write to file.
     - Write to database.
     
## Bottlenecks

- RAM:
     - Raw data does not fit into memory.
     - Transformations enlarge RAM allocation (copying).
- Mass Storage: Reading/Writing
- CPU: Parsing (data types)

# Data Preparation with `ff`

## Set up

The following examples are based on @walkowiak_2016, Chapter 3.

```{r}

## SET UP ------------------------

#Set working directory to the data and airline_id files.
# setwd("materials/code_book/B05396_Ch03_Code")
system("mkdir ffdf")
options(fftempdir = "ffdf")

# load packages
library(ff)
library(ffbase)
library(pryr)

# fix vars
FLIGHTS_DATA <- "../code_book/B05396_Ch03_Code/flights_sep_oct15.txt"
AIRLINES_DATA <- "../code_book/B05396_Ch03_Code/airline_id.csv"

```

## Data import

```{r}

# DATA IMPORT ------------------

# 1. Upload flights_sep_oct15.txt and airline_id.csv files from flat files. 

system.time(flights.ff <- read.table.ffdf(file=FLIGHTS_DATA,
                                          sep=",",
                                          VERBOSE=TRUE,
                                          header=TRUE,
                                          next.rows=100000,
                                          colClasses=NA))

airlines.ff <- read.csv.ffdf(file= AIRLINES_DATA,
                             VERBOSE=TRUE,
                             header=TRUE,
                             next.rows=100000,
                             colClasses=NA)
# check memory used
mem_used()

```


## Comparison with `read.table`

```{r}

##Using read.table()
system.time(flights.table <- read.table(FLIGHTS_DATA, 
                                        sep=",",
                                        header=TRUE))

gc()

system.time(airlines.table <- read.csv(AIRLINES_DATA,
                                       header = TRUE))


# check memory used
mem_used()

```


## Inspect imported files

```{r}
# 2. Inspect the ffdf objects.
## For flights.ff object:
class(flights.ff)
dim(flights.ff)
## For airlines.ff object:
class(airlines.ff)
dim(airlines.ff)

```

## Data cleaning and transformation

Goal: merge airline data to flights data


```{r}
# step 1: 
## Rename "Code" variable from airlines.ff to "AIRLINE_ID" and "Description" into "AIRLINE_NM".
names(airlines.ff) <- c("AIRLINE_ID", "AIRLINE_NM")
names(airlines.ff)
str(airlines.ff[1:20,])
```


## Data cleaning and transformation

Goal: merge airline data to flights data

```{r}
# merge of ffdf objects
mem_change(flights.data.ff <- merge.ffdf(flights.ff, airlines.ff, by="AIRLINE_ID"))
#The new object is only 551.2 Kb in size
class(flights.data.ff)
dim(flights.data.ff)
dimnames.ffdf(flights.data.ff)
```

## Inspect difference to in-memory operation

```{r}
##For flights.table:
names(airlines.table) <- c("AIRLINE_ID", "AIRLINE_NM")
names(airlines.table)
str(airlines.table[1:20,])

# check memory usage of merge in RAM 
mem_change(flights.data.table <- merge(flights.table,
                                       airlines.table,
                                       by="AIRLINE_ID"))
#The new object is already 105.7 Mb in size
#A rapid spike in RAM use when processing
```

## Type conversion: ff factor

```{r}

# Inspect the current variable
table.ff(flights.data.ff$DAY_OF_WEEK)
head(flights.data.ff$DAY_OF_WEEK)

# Convert numeric ff DAY_OF_WEEK vector to a ff factor:
flights.data.ff$WEEKDAY <- cut.ff(flights.data.ff$DAY_OF_WEEK, 
                                   breaks = 7, 
                                   labels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", 
                                              "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
                                              "Friday", "Saturday",
                                              "Sunday"))
# inspect the result
head(flights.data.ff$WEEKDAY)
table.ff(flights.data.ff$WEEKDAY)

```



## Subsetting

```{r}
mem_used()

# Subset the ffdf object flights.data.ff:
subs1.ff <- subset.ffdf(flights.data.ff, CANCELLED == 1, 
                        select = c(FL_DATE, AIRLINE_ID, 
                                   ORIGIN_CITY_NAME,
                                   ORIGIN_STATE_NM,
                                   DEST_CITY_NAME,
                                   DEST_STATE_NM,
                                   CANCELLATION_CODE))

dim(subs1.ff)
mem_used()

```


## Save to ffdf-files
(For further processing with `ff`)

```{r}
# Save a newly created ffdf object to a data file:

save.ffdf(subs1.ff, overwrite = TRUE) #7 files (one for each column) created in the ffdb directory

```


## Load ffdf-files

```{r}
# Loading previously saved ffdf files:
rm(subs1.ff)
gc()
load.ffdf("ffdb")
str(subs1.ff)
dim(subs1.ff)
dimnames(subs1.ff)
```

## Export to CSV

```{r message=FALSE}
#  Export subs1.ff into CSV and TXT files:
write.csv.ffdf(subs1.ff, "subset1.csv")

```
